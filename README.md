# Pipelined-MIPS-Processor

This project implements a MIPS processor using pipelines.

## Instructions
- **Arithmetic/Logical Instructions**: add, addi, sub, slt, slti
- **Memory Reference** Instructions: lw, sw
- **Control Flow Instructions**: j, jal, jr, beq, bne

## Test Program
To demonstrate the processor's functionality, a test program is provided. The "instructions.txt" file contains a set of assembly language instructions that calculate the sum of the elements of an array and store the result at the 2000th index of memory.
